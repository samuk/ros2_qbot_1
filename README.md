# robotics_ros2_python_cpp
Basic robotics code, some using ROS 2.0 Dashing, some does not use ROS 2.0, starting out with Python but plan to add C++ as well.  This interacts with the code in repo "freertos_stm32_motor_control".  The src folder contains some ROS and some non-ROS code.  Portions of the code acts as a communication and supervisory interface for the freertos code.
